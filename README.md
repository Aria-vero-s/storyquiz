# Story quiz

Story quiz is a site that hopes to support online learning. The site will be targeted towards school teachers or online tutors and young children. The site will be useful to them by proving a free reading quiz based on the books of their choice. The user only needs to send the requested information through the contact page and will receive a quiz like the one shown on the about page.
